# EconomyShipsPlus
This mod adds majority of the ships in the space engineers prefabs folder that are not normally for sale in the standard economy. I did modify a few of the ships, primarily the legacy ships which did not have pressurized rooms or closable hangars.

I plan to go through and add some more of the ships I passed over because they required a lot of work to be viable. There's also several legacy ships I personally would like to update as a MKII edition which would be refitted with newer blocks to replace outdated workarounds.

Currently this mod adds 66 ships that are actually already in the game in some scenario, some of which may no longer be available.

Also plan on adding several of my own personal blueprints to this mod as well.
